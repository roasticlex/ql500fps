Attached is an executable to run Quake Live at 500 FPS. Even having a monitor <250hz, using this will make your game feel better.

QL500FPS.7z - contains the files to run. All are necessary.

QL500FPSSOURCE.7z - contains the source code, decompiled from the files contained in the other archive. I used dnspy to decompile the executable and binaries. Feel free to do the same. You can also recompile the source if you don't trust the files in the QL500FPS.7z archive.

Usage
Extract archive QL500FPS.7z
Open QL
Run the .exe
If patched, you may close the cmd window

If you get an error for mismatch, restart your game and run the .exe again.

At 90+ ping you may get some stuttering, and I wouldn't recommend using it playing cross-region.

Note: I don't know of anyone who has gotten a VAC/Game ban for using this, and the risk of getting one in my opinion is about zero. However, you should understand what you're using and the risks associated. (edited)
